# 📈 Apple Stock Price Forecasting with ARIMA

This project demonstrates how to forecast Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices using the ARIMA model on time-series data. It includes trend decomposition, stationarity checks, ACF/PACF analysis, model fitting, and forecasting—all implemented in Python using free and open-source tools.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AAPL_ARIMA_Forecast.git
   cd AAPL_ARIMA_Forecast

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn

python aapl_arima_forecast.py

# 📊 Workflow Overview
Load and visualize the AAPL stock price data

Check stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test

Plot ACF and PACF to identify ARIMA parameters

Split data into training and testing sets

Fit ARIMA model and generate forecasts

Visualize predictions and calculate RMSE

# ✅ Outcome
By completing this project, you’ll learn how to:

Analyze time-series data

Apply ARIMA modeling for forecasting

Evaluate model performance

Visualize trends and predictions

# 📌 Notes
The dataset must contain a Date column and a Close price column.

If your CSV uses different column names, update the script accordingly.

You can extend this project by integrating Streamlit for interactive dashboards or exporting forecasts to CSV.
