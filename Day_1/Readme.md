# 🏡 Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to predict housing prices using a **simple Linear Regression model** in Python.  
We use features from the **Boston Housing-like dataset** (average rooms, lower-income percentage, pupil-teacher ratio) to predict **median home values**.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset (`housing.csv`) contains 489 entries with the following columns:

- **RM** → Average number of rooms per dwelling  
- **LSTAT** → % of lower-income households  
- **PTRATIO** → Pupil–teacher ratio by town  
- **MEDV** → Median value of owner-occupied homes (Target variable)
